## Solution Retrospective

### What Iâ€™m most proud of

- I successfully implemented **hover, focus, and active states** on the blog title and links.
- The card layout scales beautifully across **mobile, tablet, and desktop** screens.
- Used **variable fonts** for optimized font loading and flexibility.

**Next time**, I would consider adding more **animations** or **interactive elements**, such as expanding content or a light/dark theme toggle.

### Challenges and how I overcame them

- Ensuring consistent spacing and alignment for different screen sizes was challenging.  
  â†’ Used **Flexbox** and careful **padding/margin adjustments** with media queries.  
- Implementing **accessible keyboard focus states** for the title required adding `tabindex` and proper CSS focus styles.

### Areas for Improvement / Feedback Needed

- Are there better ways to handle **responsive typography** for very large screens?  
- Could the **hover/focus animation** be smoother without affecting performance?
